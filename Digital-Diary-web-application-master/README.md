# Digital-Diary-web-application ðŸ“–ðŸ“–
### A internet and web programming project

Our project is a web application which provides users to maintain a digital diary. <br />
Since users would like to ensure their privacy for what they write here, appropriate functions are used to protect their data. <br />
The project outcome is to present a more functional and efficient way to maintain their diaries than the traditional paper diaries. <br />


A diary, then, in its simplest form, is a record of each day. Keeping a diary is a matter of keeping a record of what happens in your life: the interesting and the mundane, and your thoughts and feelings about both. <br />
Diaries have the unique ability to slow us down a little, allowing us to function more efficiently and effectively, improving our well-being in the long run. <br />
It will offer a range of advantages compared to the paper version of diaries. <br />
Following are some of the benefits of keeping a diary:
* Keeping a diary has been shown to be good for the mental health
* Keeping a diary helps to improve oneâ€™s writing
* Keeping a diary can help one to remember events and activities
